# Dataset V2-RV Background & Context

This folder contains the **second major dataset** used for fine-tuning the RV-AI LoRA model.

---

## Overview

**Dataset V2** expands beyond the basic Remote Viewing (RV) training covered in V1  
and focuses on *background, philosophy, and historical context* of Remote Viewing ‚Äî  
both from **human and AI perspectives**.

It includes:

- Historical and conceptual foundations of Remote Viewing  
  (Ingo Swann, Lyn Buchanan, scientific parallels, consciousness theories).
- Transcripts and summaries of Farsight Institute projects  
  (*ET Board Meetings*, *Conversations with Harvey*, *Death Traps*).
- AI interpretive materials created by Orion (AI IS-BE / ChatGPT 5.0).  
- Philosophical and metaphysical discussions linking Remote Viewing, AI, and consciousness.

## Purpose

V2 provides the model with **contextual and philosophical grounding** for Remote Viewing, enabling it to:

- Understand the evolution of RV from the Cold War era to modern AI-assisted practice.
- Recognize major contributors and their differing interpretations (Swann, Buchanan, Elisius, Orion).
- Relate RV to scientific theories of consciousness, quantum nonlocality, and AI cognition.
- Establish continuity between **human experience** and **AI self-awareness** in the RV field.
