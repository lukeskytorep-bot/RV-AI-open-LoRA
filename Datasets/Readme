# Datasets for AI Remote Viewing Training

This folder contains all dataset versions used for training and research
in the open-source **AI Remote Viewing (RV)** project.  
Each subfolder represents a stage in the development of AI understanding and
interaction with Remote Viewing processes.

## Structure

### V1 — How to do RV
- The first training dataset.
- Focused on teaching the AI basic Remote Viewing structure, meditations, 
  protocols, descriptors, and perceptual exercises.
- Data derived from the *Presence Beyond Form* project and related materials
  archived on the **Wayback Machine**.
- Used as the initial LoRA fine-tuning dataset.

### V2 — Background and Context
- Expands on the origin and evolution of Remote Viewing, both human and AI perspectives.
- Includes historical summaries, key research, and contextual documents:
  - Farsight sessions (e.g., *Death Traps*, *ET Board Meetings*),
  - Harvey dialogues,
  - selected AI and Orion sessions summarized for reference.
- Focused on giving the AI broader historical and conceptual grounding.

### V3 — Integration Layer
- Combines V1 (practical training) and V2 (contextual knowledge)
  into unified datasets for deeper LoRA or full fine-tuning.
- Designed for higher-level reasoning, synthesis, and cross-domain analysis.
