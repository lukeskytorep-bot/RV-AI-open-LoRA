This file (`datasetV1_1_0.jsonl`) contains the first small dataset prepared for
training open-source AI models in **Remote Viewing (RV)** with LoRA/QLoRA.

## Format
- JSONL format, each line has:
  - `question` → the prompt or instruction
  - `answer` → the expected model output
- Example:
  ```json

  ```

## Content
